Problem Statement: Evaluating the Effectiveness of SHIF/SHA using SQL Analysis

Objective:
You are tasked with analyzing the provided SHIF/SHA data to evaluate its performance, impact, and identify opportunities for improvement. 
Use SQL techniques such as CTEs, Temp Tables, Joins, Unions, Subqueries, and Window Functions where necessary.

Tasks:

1. Enrollment and Demographics:
- What is the distribution of members by income level and employment status?
- How many members are subsidized versus non-subsidized across different regions?
- What is the average age of members by region? (Use CTEs)

2. Contributions and Penalties:
- Calculate the total contributions received monthly. (Use Temp Tables)
- Identify members who have penalties greater than 100 KES.
- Find the top 5 employers contributing the highest total amount.

3. Healthcare Services Utilization:
- Which types of healthcare services are most utilized?
- Calculate the average out-of-pocket expenses per service type and region.
- Find members with the highest total healthcare costs but lowest coverage. (Use Subqueries)

4. Provider Performance:
- List providers with the highest number of services offered.
- Find providers accredited within the last 2 years and compare their claim approval rates.

5. Claims Analysis:
- What is the total claim amount by claim status (Approved, Pending, Rejected)?
- Identify discrepancies where claim amount does not match the covered amount for services.

6. Surveys and Sentiment Analysis:
- What is the average satisfaction score by region?
- Is there a correlation between trust levels and satisfaction scores? (Consider using CASE WHEN for categorization)

7. Legal Risks:
- How many legal cases are pending?
- List legal cases by impact level and find the average filing duration from filing date to today.

Advanced Challenges:
- Create a member healthcare utilization profile (number of services, average costs, satisfaction level) using JOINs across multiple tables.
- Using UNION, combine high penalty members and low satisfaction members into a 'high-risk' group.

Deliverables:
- Write SQL queries to answer each question.
- Where appropriate, use CTEs, Temp Tables, Joins, Subqueries, Unions, and Window Functions to optimize your solutions.

Note:
Ensure queries are efficient and readable.
Document assumptions where necessary.

Write a report explaining the findings and analysis from the data.
