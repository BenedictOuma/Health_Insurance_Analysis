# SHIF/SHA EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS 

## Problem Statement

*Evaluating the Effectiveness of SHIF/SHA using SQL Analysis*

This project focused on assessing the performance and impact of the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) and Social Health Authority (SHA).  
Using a structured dataset, I applied SQL techniques to extract insights, evaluate system effectiveness, and highlight areas for improvement.

## Objectives & Analytical Tasks

### 1. Enrollment & Demographics
- Distribution of members by *income level* and *employment status*
- Comparison of *subsidized vs. non-subsidized* members by region
- *Average age* of members by region

### 2. Contributions & Penalties
- Total *monthly contributions*
- Members with *penalties above 100 KES*
- *Top 5 employers* by contribution amount

### 3. Healthcare Services Utilization
- Most *utilized healthcare services*
- *Out-of-pocket expenses* by service type and region
- High-cost members with *low insurance coverage*

### 4. Provider Performance
- Providers with the *highest service volumes*
- Analysis of *recently accredited providers* and their *claim approval rates*

### 5. Claims Analysis
- Total *claim amounts* segmented by status (Approved, Pending, Rejected)
- Detection of *discrepancies* between claim amount and covered services

### 6. Survey & Sentiment
- *Average satisfaction scores* by region
- Relationship between *trust* and *satisfaction levels*

### 7. Legal Risks
- Count of *pending legal cases*
- Legal cases by *impact level* and *average filing duration*

### Advanced Insights
- *Healthcare utilization profile* for each member
- Combining *high-penalty* and *low-satisfaction* members into a *high-risk group*

## My Contribution

As part of my project, I:
- Cleaned and analyzed the SHIF/SHA data using advanced *SQL queries*
- Summarized patterns and performance metrics for different regions and providers
- Built *interactive dashboards* in *Power BI, **Excel, and **Tableau* to visualize insights and KPIs
- Focused on making the outputs actionable for decision-makers and policy evaluation
